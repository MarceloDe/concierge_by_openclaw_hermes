# Workerprototype OpenClaw Project Operating System

Status: Phase 35 canonical guide.

This document is the repo mirror of the Cortex long-term project objective. It governs future development after Phase 31. Cortex remains the canonical source; this file is the local executable mirror that agents must read before planning or coding.

## Source Of Truth Order

1. Cortex semantic project note for the active phase.
2. Most recent Cortex episodic alignment note for `workerprototype_openclaw`.
3. This operating-system file.
4. `docs/PHASE_SCOREBOARD.md`.
5. `docs/NON_MOCKED_PROOF_RULES.md`.
6. `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`, and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
7. `brainstyworkers_ai_concierge_prompt.md` as historical product context only.

If these sources conflict, Cortex wins. If current code contradicts Cortex, pause and write the contradiction into the next plan before changing architecture.

## Durable Objective

Build a production-grade, memory-first, multi-channel healthcare insurance concierge:

- LangGraph owns healthcare journey state, routing, approvals, evidence fan-in, product-memory timing, and final response policy.
- OpenClaw is a bounded proposing and solving worker inside assigned LangGraph tasks.
- FastAPI `/api/v1` is the public connector for remote clients.
- Node remains the internal runtime until a separate migration is explicitly approved.
- Product memory is Graphiti/FalkorDB or another explicit runtime product-memory adapter, never Cortex.
- Cortex is project memory for agents, planning, proof, and handoffs.
- Every insurance factual claim must be supported by source pointers or a safe caveat.
- External/write/browser actions require an explicit approval contract.
- No agent may enter credentials, solve 2FA/captcha, submit forms, contact payers, change records, make payments, file appeals, or provide medical advice.

## Phase Execution Contract

Every phase must be goal-tied. A phase is valid only when it has:

- phase number and slug;
- branch from fresh `origin/main`;
- product goal;
- non-goals;
- affected surfaces;
- expected code modules;
- explicit acceptance gates;
- visual/browser proof when UI or browser behavior changes;
- non-mocked proof requirements;
- safety boundaries;
- local commands;
- dashboard/API proof key;
- worker repo PR;
- Cortex episodic and semantic/procedural PR when durable knowledge changes.

No phase is done until both the worker repo changes and Cortex memory changes land on `main`, unless the phase is explicitly planning-only and the user approves no repo code.

## RALPH Loop

Use this loop for each phase:

1. Requirements: read Cortex, repo AGENTS, active docs, source files, and current blockers.
2. Architecture: choose the smallest stable change that advances the durable objective.
3. Loop: implement one vertical slice from API/UI to runtime/test proof.
4. Prove: run focused tests, build, local tests, API proof, and visual proof when applicable.
5. Harden: add guardrails and regression tests after the slice works.
6. Record: update docs, dashboard score, artifacts, PRs, and Cortex.

## Role Model

Use role separation even when one Codex session performs the work:

- Planner: defines phase goal, non-goals, and gates.
- Implementer: changes code/docs inside the approved phase.
- Verifier: runs tests, API proof, and visual proof.
- Reviewer: checks safety, PHI, secrets, OpenClaw/LangGraph authority, and source grounding.
- Cortex Scribe: writes episodic, semantic, and procedural memory after proof.

For real multi-agent runs, each role must use its own Cortex branch and author identity when supported. Do not let multiple agents push unrelated edits into the same feature branch without a single phase owner.

## Active Intelligence Phase

Phase 35 adds supervised promotion gates for PEMS candidates on top of the Phase 34 durable shadow substrate:

- append-only shadow-run ledger;
- aggregate PEMS candidate maturity;
- real LangGraph final-trace persistence after response/product-memory retain;
- explicit human reviewer approvals;
- validator/evaluator pass requirements;
- cited-evidence sufficiency checks;
- safety-incident vetoes;
- supervised advisory mode as the only possible promotion state;
- existing `case_state_shadow` graph node remains the pre-answer shadow checkpoint;
- dashboard proof for `continuous_intelligence_shadow_persistence` and `pems_supervised_promotion_gate`;
- production decisioning still disabled.

Phase 35 does not let procedural reconstruction drive recommendations. It lets a mature candidate become supervised-advisory-visible only after review gates pass, while keeping `productionDrivingAllowed=false`.

## Recommended Next Phases

Phase 36 should connect supervised advisory candidates to a reviewer-facing evaluation workbench:

- LLM-assisted evaluator draft notes routed through the same review ledger;
- NeSTR-style consistency traces rendered as refs, not raw PHI;
- reviewer diff between deterministic and advisory outputs;
- no automatic production recommendations.

Phase 36 must still keep healthcare authority in LangGraph and keep OpenClaw bounded by assigned tasks and explicit approvals.
